Abstract (Simple Version)

Preparing for coding interviews, especially Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), is difficult without personal guidance. Most existing platforms only check whether a solution passes test cases and do not explain why a solution is right or wrong.

This project introduces an Adaptive AI Tutor that behaves like a real interview mentor. It uses a Large Language Model (LLM) together with a secure code-execution system to analyze the user’s code step by step. Instead of just giving the correct answer, the tutor runs the code on hidden test cases, checks logic and efficiency, and provides clear feedback on mistakes, time and space complexity, and coding style.

The system also adapts to the learner’s skill level. If a user struggles with certain topics, the tutor automatically adjusts future questions to focus on those weak areas. This creates a personalized learning experience that helps users improve their problem-solving skills and gain confidence for technical interviews. (See <attachments> above for file contents.
